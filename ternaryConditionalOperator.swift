// The ternary conditional operator, denoted by a ?, offers a shorter, more concise alternative to a standard if/else statement. It executes one of two expressions depending on the boolean result of the condition.
// A ternary conditional consists of three parts in the following format:
// A ? B :C
// A is the condition to check for
// B is the expression to use if the condition is true
// C is the expression to use if the condition is false

// EXAMPLE

var orderSuccessfullyPlaced = false 

if orderSuccessfullyPlaced {
  print("Your order was received.")
} else {
  print("Something went wrong.")
}

orderSuccessfullyPlaced ? print("Your order was received.") : print("Something went wrong.")

var windy = true 

if windy {
  print("Sails up")
} else {
  print("Motor on")
}

// Write your code below ⛵

windy ? print("Sails up") : print("Motor on")
